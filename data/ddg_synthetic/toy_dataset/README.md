## Toy Dataset Description
This is a toy dataset consisting of 400 synthetic FoldX ddG values (20 randomly selected mutations from 20 randomly selected PDBs). The PDBs have no more than 90% length-matched CDR sequence identity.

## PDB files
The PDBs for the toy dataset can be downloaded from: https://opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/data/downloads/affinity_dataset/
  - WT: toy_synthetic_ddg_wt_pdbs.tar.gz (4.5 MB compressed; 19 MB uncompressed)
  - Mutant: toy_synthetic_ddg_mutated_pdbs.tar.gz (90 MB compressed; 366 MB uncompressed)

The WT pdb files are named [pdb].pdb (eg 3w2d.pdb). The mutant PDB files are named [pdb]\_[antibody\_chains]\_[antigen\_chains]\_[mutation\_id].pdb (eg 3w2d\_HL\_A\_EL1A.pdb)
